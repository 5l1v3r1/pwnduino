# pwnduino
Hacking with the Arduino Uno!

## Introduction

Many projects have existed out there (check out @samyk !) that turn Arduino HID keyboard devices into USB rubber ducky-likes. However, these devices are already themselves HID devices, and just require a bit of code in the form of Arduino `.ino` scripts to run. At times, many people are not able to obtain Teensy devices, or just simply want to work their existing hardware. We were able to built a framework that turns Arduino Unos into malicious HID devices, dubbed __pwnduino__, and effectively hack and gain escalated privilege and persistence on an open computer.

## How it Works

An Arduino Uno (version rev. 3) has an `atmega16u2` chip on its board. We can flash this chip using a program called `dfu-programmer`, available on Linux distributions

    sudo apt-get install dfu-programmer

or, build from source [here](https://dfu-programmer.github.io/).

We get two `.hex` files, one for a USB serial device, and one for an HID keyboard device. __pwnduino__ automates that process, first flashing the Arduino Uno into a serial device. However this still does require a bit of __user input__, as you will be required to do what is known as placing the Arduino into __DFU Mode__. In order to do this, you can take
a jumper wire, and short the __GND pin__ and the top left __ICSP pin__.

After doing so, the Arduino's onboard LED will light up for a few short moments. Your Arduino will be ready to be flashed. __pwnduino__ will do this automatically.

Afterwards, you can still upload scripts to the Arduino. Once the Arduino is flashed into a HID device, it will automatically execute that code. Several scripts have been included, however, you can still write your own.

After uploading a script, __pwnduino__ will flash your Arduino into a keyboard HID device. Plug it into a vulnerable, and open computer, and watch the magic (not really) happen.

## Downloading and Installation

First, several requirements are needed. Install with your respective OS's package manager, or build from source.

    sudo apt install arduino arduino-core arduino-mk dfu-programmer python-pip
    sudo pip install signal pyserial arduino-sketch

Get the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/pwnduino
    cd /path/to/pwnduino
    python pwnduino.py


## Usage

This is the output of `--help`

    usage: pwnduino.py [-h] [--flash] [--unflash] [--detect]

    Hacking with the Arduino Uno

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help      show this help message and exit
    --flash, -f     Flash your Arduino Uno into a malicious HID Device
    --unflash, -uf  Revert your Arduino Uno into a regular serial device
    --detect, -d    Attempts to detect your regular Arduino serial device

Now here's how to use it.

To detect if an Arduino is plugged in, use `--detect`. Keep in mind this only works for USb serial devices that aren't detected as a keyboard. To check for hardware changes, use `dmesg`.

    python pwnduino.py --detect

Before you flash to a HID, upload a script. Scripts are currently in the `scripts/` folder, and a work-in-progress `--upload` flag is being implemented.

To flash, use `--flash`. Keep in mind that you should short the GND and ICSP pins, as demonstrated above.

    python pwnduino.py --flash

To unflash, use `--unflash`. Once again, short the pins. You will now have a regular serial USB device again.

## TODO

This project still presets to us A LOT of potential issues, and we wish to improve upon them. Hacking with the Arduino Uno has already been seen previously after the introduction of the Teensy and the Rubber Ducky. The Arduino Uno is not the only model of the Arduino family that can be potentially hacked and turned into a malicious HID, but also other models, such as the Mega. These challenges present to us countless possibilities and even potential hardware modifications that enable us to enhance the overall effective of the program.
